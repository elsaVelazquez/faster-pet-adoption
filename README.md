# Dogs In Shelters
### Are there *really* more female dogs in animal rescue shelters than male dogs?

![raw counts of male vs female dogs](src/readme/raw_counts.png)

## Data science application: Hypothesis Testing--> 
### Ho : There are 50% female dogs in shelters.  
### Ha : It is not the case that there are 50% female dogs in shelters.  
<br />
#### Statistic:  A binomial test using stats.binom.

Our goal is to ascertain whethere there is a statistically significant difference betwee female vs male dog populations in animal rescue shelters. 

<br />

Conclusion: Because p != alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine there are not 50% female dogs in shelters.

### Is this the case for *all* subrgroups of dogs?

### Web Scraping for Data Collection

The data was collected using <a href="https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/json_data_cleaning.py">OS-level Curl command line prompt </a>, written in python, that sped up the collection of 200,000 records from PetFinder's public API to less than 1 minute.

<br />

### Data Ingestion

Due to the API, the scrape returned 5000 JSON files with 20 records each. 
These records were mashed into 1 giant JSON file that revealed a <a href="https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/readme/schemas.txt">multi-level schema</a> when put through a PySpark pipeline.

## Next steps --> IMG Classification Using ML <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html>Scikit-Learn</a>
  
#### The next question:  Is an animal's online presence a predictor of its adoptability? 

Does the pose of a dog influence how fast it gets adopted from a rescue shelter?

By classifying animal shelter data using image processing and tracing an animal's dates of arrival and departure from a shelter, it can be decided if we should fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine that pets are too adorable to be left, no matter how they pose for the cameera.  
In the following image, it is clear to see the image classification categories, as pets are either:
