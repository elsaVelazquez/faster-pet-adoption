# Dogs In Shelters

|Are there *really* more male dogs in animal rescue shelters than female dogs?|https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/readme/imgs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-16%20at%202.47.09%20AM.png width=300 align=right|

## Data science application: 
### Ho : There are 50% male dogs in shelters.  
### Ha : It is not the case that there are 50% male dogs in shelters.  

### Statistic:  A normal distribution, 2-tail test, 
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html">scipy.stats.ttest_ind</a>

We see that there are, by the numbers, more male than female dogs, but our goal is to ascertain whethere there is a statistically significant difference in male vs female dog populations in animal rescue shelters.

#### Conclusion:
If p < alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine there are not 50% male dogs in shelters, and our sample does not come from a noraml distribution.  


Does the pose of a dog influence how fast it gets adopted from a rescue shelter?

#### Is an animal's online presence a predictor of its adoptability? 

## Next phase --> IMG Classification Using ML <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html>Scikit-Learn</a>
By classifying animal shelter data using image processing and tracing an animal's dates of arrival and departure from a shelter, it can be decided if we should fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine that pets are too adorable to be left, no matter how they pose for the cameera.  
In the following image, it is clear to see the image classification categories, as pets are either:
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Standing
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Sitting
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Laying
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Clothed

It is also evident in our JSON files that we are able to determine an animal's length of stay.

The length of stay is the key feature in this analysis, barring potential bias given the age of the animal.  The suspected age of the animal is also a included in the data set.  It is accounted for by grouping using age categories, as deemed necessary.  

We can use the IDs given by PetFinder as unique identifiers in the data set to track the animals.  As is seen in this JSON file, the URL is associated with said pet ID. 

## NLP
Aside from image classification, the dataset also contains descriptions of the animals, which can be analyzed using bag of words or other NLP methods.  

## Minimum Viable Product
# Data Set
The minimum viable product for Capstone 1 will be a dataset of images downloaded using RESTful API calls.  The src folder contains the stub used to generate the images.  

<img src="https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/readme/imgs/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-16%20at%2012.16.47%20AM.png" width=600 align=center>
Web scraping will be necessary to determine if an animal is already adopted, given permission is granted.  The web scraping will be done only if the API owners, who grant public access to their API, do not track arrival vs. adoption dates.  When a pet is adpoted, their JSON no longer displays the term "status":"adoptable," and instead their page provides a list of other animals that are up for adoption.  

# Data Collection
To approach the project methodically and to limit bias, a JSON file is printed per month for the last 2-3 years.  Each JSON file contains over 6,000 records, depending on how many new pets were available at that time.  
The data was quite cumbersome to handle and difficult to find, so there remains much to look forward to in terms of EDA.

# Data Structures
For Capstone I, the underlying data structure will be a dictionary of dictionaries, as can be seen in the image below.  The JSON data is cumbersome to work with, but once turned into dictionaries, it will prove to be more efficient to work with.  The images themselves are rather blurry, which is why the classification algorithm will be rather basic (body position and in dog garments or not in dog garments).  

# Data Access
The data is gathered using a curl command in the command terminal, using an API issued by PetFinders.
