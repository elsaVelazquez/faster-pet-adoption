#### Is an animal's online presence a predictor of its adoptability? 

By classifying animal shelter data using image processing and tracing an animal's dates of arrival and departure from a shelter, it can be decided if we should fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine that pets are too adorable to be left, no matter how they pose for the cameera.  
In the following image, it is clear to see the image classification categories, as pets are either:

- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Sitting
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Laying
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Clothed

It is also evident in our JSON files that we are able to determine an animal's length of stay.



We can use the IDs given by PetFinder as unique identifiers in the data set to track the animals.  As is seen in this JSON file, the URL is associated with said pet ID.
