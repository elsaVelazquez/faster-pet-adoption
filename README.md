### Are there *really* more female dogs in animal rescue shelters than male dogs?

![raw counts of male vs female dogs](src/readme/raw_counts.png)

## Data science application: Hypothesis Testing--> 
### Ho : There are 50% female dogs in shelters.  
### Ha : It is not the case that there are 50% female dogs in shelters.  
<br />

### Statistic:  A binomial test using stats.binom.

The goal is to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between female vs male dog populations in animal rescue shelters. 

<br />

### Conclusion: 
Because p != alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and determine there are not 50% female dogs in shelters.

<br />

### Is this the case for *all* subrgroups of dogs?

### There are more male adult dogs in shelters.

## Data Wrangling
### Web Scraping for Data Collection

The data was collected using <a href="https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/json_data_cleaning.py">OS-level Curl command line prompt </a>, written in python, that sped up the collection of 200,000 records from PetFinder's public API to less than 1 minute.

<br />

### Data Ingestion

Due to the API, the scrape returned 5000 JSON files with 20 records each. 
These records were mashed into 1 giant JSON file that revealed a <a href="https://github.com/elsaVelazquez/faster-pet-adoption/blob/master/src/readme/schemas.txt">multi-level schema</a> when put through a PySpark pipeline.

### The next question:  Does the adult male dog's picture pose influence how fast it gets adopted from a rescue shelter?

## Machine Learning

### Image Processing
Using img data from PetFinder.com, I began the process of image classification by finding existing python <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html">Scikit-Learn</a>, scikit-image libraries for image flattening.

## By classifying animal shelter images and arrival and departure dates, a new hypothesis emerges from the data and we can now use science to determine if specific advertising methods can be used to help the adult male dog population.  
The feature selection process involves best methods to classify imgs with male dogs that are:
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Standing
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Sitting
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Laying
- ![#9900c5](https://placehold.it/15/9900c5?text=+)Clothed

<br /> <br />
## Future Work
<br />
Through this dataset, it is possible to determine when and where there will be an influx of male dogs to which rescue shelters, and those shelters can then be informed of the conclusions of this investigation to help them best present the male dogs to help balance the ratio of adult males in animal rescue shelters.
